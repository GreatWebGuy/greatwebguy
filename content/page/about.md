Welcome to greatwebguy.com. I'm Jason Crow, owner and author.  I've been programming
in one form or another since the 5th grade and have had the opportunity to grow up with the web.
I've been writing web applications for more than 20 years. Currently, I have a lot of interest
in cloud native technologies, like Kubernetes and the Go programming language. I have been utilizing these
technologies to build robust, fast, continuously deployed systems.  I hope you enjoy my posts,
some articles on the site are pretty old and may no longer apply, so make sure you pay attention to the
post dates.
