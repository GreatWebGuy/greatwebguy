You wouldn't leave the door to your house unlocked at night in the hopes
that you'll catch a thief red-handed, would you? Then why wait until
thieves open credit accounts in your name before being notified that
there's a problem.

Up until recently I was a big proponent of Equifax's Credit Watch
service, whereby an email notification is received whenever a change
occurs to your credit report. You then have to sift through the changes
and make sure nothing fraudulent has occurred. Sounds a little too late
to me, after all if something has happened and somebody has managed to
steal your identity and open credit in your name, the damage is already
done and you're left a mess to clean up.

Enters LifeLock, this is a service at the forefront of a new type of
credit protection that's more proactive and preventative in nature than
a Credit Watch service. When you sign up with LifeLock, which costs
about $10/month, the first thing they do is set a Fraud Alert at all of
the credit agencies and keep the Fraud Alert active and up to date. Now
there's no need to be anxious about the Fraud Alert, it's a method of
putting the agencies on a heightened level of security and requiring any
agency requesting your credit report to have a phone conversation with
you first. This way you get a phone call before the thief is even able
to open the line of credit. LifeLock also takes a few other actions such
as removing you from several mailing lists for preauthorized credit card
offers. Once signed up you're backed by $1 million dollars in
protection against identity theft.

I wouldn't recommend the service if I didn't subscribe myself and
believe it was worthwhile. Another good bit of information is that if
you sign up to be an affiliate you can receive a 40% discount on the
service.
