There are several sites such as
[wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com) and
[blogger.com](http://www.blogger.com) where you can sign up for free and
start your blog right away.

But if you're like me, that's not good enough, you want to express your
individuality, make your own name, control your own destiny. You want
your own domain and your own host so that you have everything you need
to express yourself. This article will give you the down low on where to
reserve your own domain name, set up hosting, install blogging software,
all this at the low cost of $8.95/yr. for the domain and $3.95/mo. for
hosting.

#### Step 1: Reserve a domain name at GoDaddy

-   Get on over to [Godaddy Whois](https://who.godaddy.com/) and find an
    available domain name. Of course I'm assuming that based on the time
    constraints of this exercise you already have a name picked out. If
    the name is available, GoDaddy will offer it for sale, if not, find
    another name.


#### Step 2: Get a hosting account from Interadvantage

My favorite host for hosting small new sites is
[WebHostingBuzz](http://www.webhostingbuzz.com) Choose the option that says you already
have a domain and that your going to just update your name servers. Follow the rest of the
instructions and before you know it your hosting account will be
reserved.

#### Step 3: Update your name servers on GoDaddy

WebHostingBuzz should have sent you the names of your name servers to
the address you set up your hosting with. You'll need to login to your
[godaddy account](http://www.godaddy.com).

-   Under domains choose My Domain Names.
-   In the Domain Control Center Click the Domain Name you
    just registered.
-   Click the link under Name Servers
-   Choose custom name servers and enter the two names provided in your
    WebHostingBuzz registration email
-   Save the new names

#### Step 4: Install Wordpress using Softaculous

Use the cpanel address provided by WebHostingBuzz in your registration
email, either it's http://IP/cpanel or http://YOURDOMAIN.com/cpanel
depending if the new name servers have been picked up.

-   Login with the username and password you chose for your
    WebHostingBuzz account.
-   Click the Softaculous icon
-   Find WordPress in the list of Scripts under blogging
-   Click and fill out information to install

If you've done everything right, you should be able to go to
http://yourdomain.com and get your WordPress site, you can login and
start blogging right away.
