## Naive Architect
A long time ago in a company far far away, I was
an Architect, performing reviews and yelling at squad leaders thinking
I knew best. Got wind of this "Jedi Master" working with the squads, the word was this master had blue hair and was
spreading the force all over the Silicon galaxy. A run in with this Master caused anger to swell, he mentioned
 techniques being followed were wrong and would lead to the dark side. A skeptic always, his thoughts dismissed they were.
 Time passed and a fly by of an agile pod revealed the entire squad sitting around a single
screen, working together. After, a princess says to me she participated in a
"mob session". The stars connected and replied I did, "This is when a squad
sits around a single screen and works on the same thing? That's Stupid!!"
She replied, "You should give it a try." Resist I did.

## Padwan
Eventually the Princess convinced me to open my mind and accept the force, the force was strong. Attended my first mob
programming session, I did. It was a strict randori style. The padwan was not to think, but listen.
If the padwan misunderstood, explicit instructions were given. Quickly noticed, that the core group spoke their
own language, it all sounded like Wookie. The squad was one with the force and moved quickly.

## Apprentice
Convinced the force was strong with this Jedi Master, invited him to teach us, we did.
Resistance was met, new language was developed, new tasks conquered, the force was strong.
The Jedi Master moved the strongest with the force to be facilitators. Teaching others
to Mob and spreading the the force to new squads.

## Council
The squad spent the next year mob programming. to learn new technologies and new languages. Always
evolving and using the group to iterate on new and better solutions. The galaxy was
ours and we ran the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs. Mob Programming drastically
changed the way we coded and the way we approached new problems. Every Jedi was
on the same page, bugs were diminished, the force was strong. Along the journey
every Jedi must build their own lightsaber, [MobTime](https://github.com/GreatWebGuy/MobTime)
was my lightsaber. We used other timers in the beginning, but our padwans needed
something more. I crafted MobTime to teach the Padwans and help the defiant unruly
ones to follow the rules.

## New Masters
Moving on to new galaxies and new adventures and new Padwans. Forever grateful we will be,
for the lessons learned from Jedi Master, Llewellyn Falco. Brought Mob Programming
and many other learnings did he.  We will continue to teach new Padwans the way of the Force.
