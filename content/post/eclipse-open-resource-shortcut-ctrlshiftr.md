The biggest time-saver I've stumbled upon in Eclipse is the Open
Resource Shortcut. Under the Navigate menu is the Open Resource command,
shortcut Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows, or Commad+Shift+R on Mac, which opens a window that allows you to type a
search for any file that exists in your workspace, in your search you
can use the ? to replace a single character or * to replace an entire
string, the search is amazingly fast. If you've worked on a project for
a long time you know the names of all of your php, jsp's, classes, xml
files, and properties, and digging through the folder structure in the
Navigator and Project Explorer views can be time consuming and annoying.
I've trained my self to use it so much that IDE's that don't have a
comparable feature, like JDeveloper, annoy me to no end.
